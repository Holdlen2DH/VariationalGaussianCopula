# Variational Gaussian Copula Inference

We use Gaussian copulas with fixed/free-form margins as automated inference engines for variational approximation in generic hierarchical Bayesian models. The only two model-specific terms are the log likelihood & prior term and its derivatives. We evaluate the peculiarities reproduced in the univariate margins and the posterior dependence captured broadly across latent variables.
